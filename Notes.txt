- can connect wii board to android (open source app: fitscales)
- use accelerometer in android device?
- convert matlab scripts in to java (java can do data analysis and android only supports java)

- mean velocity of COP (center of pressure)
- COM acceleration in the anterior-posterior direction was the most statistically significant difference between the three stances (eyes closed/open, mental task) STANDING
- differences were found only in velocity and acceleration. With conditions (STR) and (MET) showing a statistical difference in acceleration in the anterior-posterior (AP) direction WALKING


- Romberg ratio - ratio of eyes closed measure to the eyes-open measure

- standing balance characterized with measures based on displaement of COP measured with force platform, teh horizontal and vertialreaction forces also measured with force platform, or horizontal displacement at subject's waist
- COP = location of vertical reaction vector on surface of force platform

TO DO:

- make sure COP computation is correct 
- for walking, mean velocity and rms distance of cop
anterior-posterior (AP) and medial-lateral (ML)

stabliogram?

android 4.2+ can't connect to wiiboard

wiiboard connects to computer but matlab scripts don't recognize it
